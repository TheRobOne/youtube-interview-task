## YouTube interview task

I did all the goals, including the bonus ones. \
YouTube api key isn't in this repository for security reasons. \
Before running the app place api key in the .env file instead of `<API_KEY_HERE>` placeholder.

## Running app

To run app with one command use `npm run start-one-command`. It will install dependencies and run the app.\
You can also use `npm run docker-build-run` to run app in the Docker container.\
To run tests use `npm run test`.\
To open cypress test runner use `npm run cypress:open`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view app in the browser.
